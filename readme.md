# WabiSabi CMS

Users:
* Edit your entire site in-line.
* Sign in using a single password to administer the site.
* Create new pages and links dynamically.
* Automatically generate the navigation for the site.
* Manage your file uploads, like images, very easily.

Designers:
* Write declarative templates with any visual style, defining areas of content that are editable.

It's sort of like a templated, user-friendly wiki, perfect for small sites, such as portfolios or small businesses.

More detailed instructions coming when the project is closer to completion.
