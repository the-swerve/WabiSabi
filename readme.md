# WabiSabi CMS

Content editors:
* Edit your entire site in-line.
* Sign in using a single password to administer the site by simply going to /wabisabi/admin.
* Create new pages and links dynamically.
* Automatically generate the navigation for the site.
* Manage your file uploads very easily.

Designers:
* Write declarative templates with any visual style, defining areas of content that are editable.

Administrators:
* Runs using PHP and javascript, and uses a file-based database, so requires practically no setup on any server.
* The database gets set up automatically without any action.
* The CMS can be automatically updated by signing in and simply going to /wabisabi/update

It's sort of like a templated, user-friendly wiki, perfect for small sites, such as portfolios or small businesses.

More detailed instructions coming when the project is closer to completion.
